# Snake_Game
This is a simple snake game written in Python. The game uses the arrow keys to control the snake's movements. The snake must eat the food to grow longer and score points. The game ends when the snake collides with the edge of the screen or with its own body.

To run the game, run the main.py file. The game window will open automatically.

The game is controlled using the following keyboard controls:

Up arrow key: Move the snake up
Down arrow key: Move the snake down
Left arrow key: Move the snake left
Right arrow key: Move the snake right
The game rules are as follows:

The snake starts at the center of the screen.
The snake must eat the food to grow longer and score points.
The game ends when the snake collides with the edge of the screen or with its own body.
The player with the highest score wins the game.
This project is an excellent introduction to game development in Python. It uses the Turtle library to create a simple and engaging game.

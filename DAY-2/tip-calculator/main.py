# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

# If we want to pay 12% as the tip, it means  we're paying 0.12*(bill amount) more
#
# So it effectively means, what you're paying is bill amount + 0.12*(bill amount)
#
# Taking bill amount common (in mathematical terms, which you do in high school), your  total pay = (bill amount) * (
# 1 + 0.12) = (bill amount)*1.12
#
#
# Now this total pay is to be divided amongst the people in the party
#
# So if there were 5 people, bill amount was 150.00, 12% tip
#
# we'll split the total pay, which is 150.00*1.12, amongst 5, = 150.00*1.12/5
